# walk_for_future
## Getting Started
Walk For Future is a project that encourages people to walk. The user registers and logs in to the application, chooses his destination on the map and starts the walk. With the pedometer running behind, time and location information, it is determined whether the user actually walks to the determined location and a reward is given according to the distance. I would like to add to the application of vehicles such as public transportation and bicycle by using artificial intelligence technologies in the future. Flutter, Dart and Firebase used in the application. Also used  Distance Matrix API for calculating the distance between start and end points and Maps SDK for Android to let the user choose the destination on the map.
